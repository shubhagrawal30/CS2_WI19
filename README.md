# Caltech CS 2 Winter Term 2019

The following repository is a record of my work for this database course "Introduction to Programming Methods".

This includes scripts that can use BFS, DFS, dynamic programming, and data structures including linked list, DE-queues, and heaps, to accomplish a range of tasks: 
solve mazes, play Othello, work as a search engine, and simulate gerrymandering.

Portions of the scripts here have dependencies absent from this repository, as there were provided by the CS 2 staff and not authored by me. Portions of this code was created in paired programming by me and a lab partner.
